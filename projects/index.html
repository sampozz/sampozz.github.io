                    "Rendicontazione" is a web application thought for internal management of bank agents. It consists of a clean dashboard interface 
                    where the client can find a summary of the data generated by electronic invoices for every agent in the company. <br><br>
                    I designed the UI with Adobe XD and developed the application using Angular framework. 
                    The data is retrieved from a Web API with RESTful communication.

                    "Marconi Webserver" is a web application which collects all the online services of the technical high school "G. Marconi" in Verona, Italy.
                    Professors, students and staff members can log in on the webserver and access a lot of features such as the lessons timetable with a 
                    customized and aesthetic user experience. I worked with a special team of four students during 2020 summer holidays. <br><br>
                    We developed the application frontend with Angular framework which connects to a Web API
                    written in Python (Flask) for the backend operations.

                <div class="project-description">
                    "CAD EAT" is the project I worked on during a three-month school internship in a team with another student. It allows 
                    employees to order a salad from the company canteen with custom ingredients.
                    We went through all the design process by interviewing the clients and proposing them different features. <br><br>
                    The application frontend works on Angular framework which communicates with a Web API backend developed using ASP.NET.  
                    We also designed the relational database which runs on Microsoft SQL Server.
